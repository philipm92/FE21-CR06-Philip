Requirements:
In this CodeReview, you have to create a travel agency web application using Angular.

GUI guideline note: You can create your own HTML/CSS theme (or with Bootstrap). 

You need to create at least three pages Home, Blog and Travels (you are free to create additional pages if you have time and inspiration). Home and Blog should have a static content. 
- Implement theme design, or design similar to the screenshots above. 
- Your project must contain at least 5 components that together should build up your project.
- Use routing to move between the pages. E.g.: your navbar contains 3 navigation links: Home, Blog and Travels. When you click Home you should see the content of the homepage. When you click Blog you should see the content for the Blog page and the Travels page will show all travel offers.
- Each travel offer should display the following details: destination, description, start date(s), duration and price. 
- Create the functionality that when you click on a travel offer in the travel section, it will be added to your cart.
- Display the shopping cart in a separate component (for example in a different page that you can access through the navbar).


Bonus Points:
- Display the final sum of all the offers the users have selected (i.e Total costs).
- If the total sum is more than EUR 200, the user gets a 10% discount. If the total sum is more than EUR 500, they get a 20% discount.
